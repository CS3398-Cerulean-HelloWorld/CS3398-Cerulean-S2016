SOUL ENSHRINED

This project is a 2 dimension turn-based, decision role playing game. The project was coded in C++, and the framework for the game was designed using the Simple Fast Media Library (SFML). The art assets are the original work of team members and were created using a free online sprite editor named Piskel.  

To build this project download Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 if it is not already installed on your machine. You will also need to download SFML version 2.4.1 from the following link http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.1/.
The version of SFML implemented in this project was Visual C++ 14 (2015) - 64-bit for Windows.
Once SFML has been downloaded and Visual Studio has been installed, the following link will link SFML with Visual Studio.

ARTWORK: All of the artwork e.g., background, monsters, and spell animations were designed using the website Piskel http://www.piskelapp.com/. Each of the drawings were handmade, however, the ideas were based off various games such as Castlevania (spell animations) and other various tutorial videos. The dimensions of most of the animations were 50x50, while others were 150x150. Using SFML's built in libraries, the animations and entities were scaled to the prefered size.
