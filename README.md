SOUL ENSHRINED

This project is a 2 dimension turn-based, decision role playing game. The project was coded in C++, and the framework for the game was designed using the Simple Fast Media Library (SFML). The art assets are the original work of team members and were created using a free online sprite editor named Piskel.  

To build this project download Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 if it is not already installed on your machine. You will also need to download SFML version 2.4.1 from the following link.

ARTWORK: All of the artwork (background, monsters, spell animations) were made using the website "http://www.piskelapp.com/". Each drawing was hand-made so to speak, however the ideas were based off various games such as castlevania (spell animations) and other various tutorial videos. Most animations were made with a dimension of 50x50, but sometimes also with 150x150. By using SFML's built in libraries, you can scale the animations/entities as you like.
